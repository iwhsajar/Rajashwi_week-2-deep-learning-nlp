# Monday Exercises: Deep Learning Foundations

## Overview

These exercises reinforce TensorBoard monitoring, autoencoder architecture, and multi-layer perceptron classification covered in today's demos. You'll build visualization skills and gain hands-on experience with foundational deep learning architectures.

## Exercise Schedule

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Prerequisites |
|----------|------|----------|---------------|
| 01: TensorBoard Exploration | Implementation | 45 min | Demo 01, Reading 01 |
| 02: Fashion-MNIST Autoencoder | Implementation | 60 min | Demo 02, Readings 02, 04 |
| 03: MLP Architecture Tuning | Implementation | 75 min | Demo 03, Readings 03, 04 |

## Prerequisites

- Completed readings: `01-04` in `readings/1-Monday/`
- Watched demos: `demo_01` through `demo_03`
- Python environment with TensorFlow 2.x, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

1. Configure TensorBoard callbacks and interpret training visualizations
2. Build and train autoencoders for image compression/reconstruction
3. Design and tune MLP architectures for classification tasks
4. Apply proper training/validation data splitting strategies

## Getting Started

```bash
cd exercises/1-Monday
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start with Exercise 01 and proceed in order. Each exercise builds on concepts from the previous one.

## Guidance Philosophy

- **Exercise 01**: Heavily guided with hints and partial code
- **Exercise 02**: Moderate guidance with some scaffolding
- **Exercise 03**: Minimal guidance - apply what you've learned independently
