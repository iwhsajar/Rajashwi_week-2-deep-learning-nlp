# Friday Exercises: Model Management & Production

## Overview

These exercises reinforce model persistence, checkpointing, early stopping, and regularization techniques covered in today's demos. You'll build production-ready training pipelines.

## Exercise Schedule

| Exercise | Type | Duration | Prerequisites |
|----------|------|----------|---------------|
| 01: Model Persistence Lab | Implementation | 45 min | Demo 01, Reading 01 |
| 02: Checkpoint Strategy | Implementation | 45 min | Demos 02-03, Readings 02-03 |
| 03: Combat Overfitting | Implementation | 60 min | Demo 04, Reading 04 |
| 04: Production Pipeline | Implementation | 60 min | All Friday demos and readings |

## Prerequisites

- Completed readings: `01-04` in `readings/5-Friday/`
- Watched demos: `demo_01` through `demo_04`
- Python environment with TensorFlow 2.x

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

1. Save and load models in multiple formats
2. Implement robust checkpointing strategies
3. Use early stopping effectively
4. Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting

## Getting Started

```bash
cd exercises/5-Friday
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start with Exercise 01 and proceed in order.

## Guidance Philosophy

- **Exercise 01**: Guided with clear steps and verification
- **Exercise 02**: Moderate guidance with scenarios
- **Exercise 03**: Minimal guidance - design your own experiments
